# Next.js
- Server side rendering of react code

## Setup
```
npx create-next-app hello-world
```

## Directory structure
- Public folder
Anything within this folder is accessible to the outside world through the domain

- Pages
	- Where the source code is present

- Styling within a component is limited to within that component

## api folder
Each function must return some value and cannot return a jsx component. This behaves like express in Node
